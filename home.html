  <h3>Welcome to Salima's website!</h3>

  <p>

    I am a PhD candidate at <a href="https://teilab.ee.ntu.edu.tw/#/home">TEILab (Taiwan Evolutionary Intelligence Laboratory)</a> advised by Dr.  <a href="https://www.ee.ntu.edu.tw/profile1.php?id=745">Tian-Li Yu</a> 
    in <a href="https://web.ee.ntu.edu.tw/eng/index.php">Electrical Engineering</a> at <a href="https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/">NTU (National Taiwan University)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Before joining TEILab, I did my Master's degree in <a href="https://www.stat.ntu.edu.tw/chinese/index.asp">Statistics</a> at NTU 
    and my Bachelor's degree in <a href="https://math.nccu.edu.tw/">Mathematics Sciences</a> at <a href="https://www.nccu.edu.tw/index.php?Lang=en">NCCU (National Chengchi University, Taiwan)</a>.
    My research focuses on <b>developing theoretical support for model-based genetic algorithms</b>,
    aiming to bridge the gap between theoretical understanding and practical applications of these algorithms in solving complex optimization problems.  
  </p>
  
  <p>
  From February to August 2023, I interned at <a href="https://www.usda.gov">USDA (United States Department of Agriculture)</a>, contributing to the development of a <a href="https://jbrowse.org/jb2/plugin_store">Linkout plugin for JBrowse 2</a>  and <b>a machine learning model for predicting images in insect databases using single nucleotide polymorphisms</b>. 
  Recently, I interned at the <a href="https://www.nii.ac.jp">NII (National Institute of Informatics, Japan)</a> from February to April 2024, focusing on <b>generating molecular graphs through model-based genetic algorithms</b>. 
  </p>

  <p>
  Subsequently, I will be a visiting student at <a href="https://www.mit.edu">MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology, USA)</a> from June 2024 to May 2025, where I will work on <b>advancing fully interpretable simulators for pre-mRNA splicing</b>. I'd love to have academic discussions with anyone, and any feedback is welcome.
